Exception handiling occur when there is some issue in our program i.e if our program is trying
to divide integer with zero then our program will generate an error of "IntegerDivisionByZeroException".

we can handel error by:
	
	1. on clause.
	2. catch clause with Exception object.
	3. catch clause with Exception object and StackTrace object.
	4. Finally clause.

- we use on clause when we know the type of error can come.

- we use catch clause when we don't know the type of error.

- we use catch clause and StackTrace object when we don't know 
  the type of error and if we wanna know what are executed 
  before error came up.

- finally clause will always execute.
