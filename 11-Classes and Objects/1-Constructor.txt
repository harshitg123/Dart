In dart we are having 4 types of constructor:
	1. Default constructor.
	2. parameterized constructor.
	3. Named constructor.
	4. constant constructor.

we will see all these constructors in our example section also constant constructor are not 
so useful in oop but it is important in GUI so w will discuss it later
