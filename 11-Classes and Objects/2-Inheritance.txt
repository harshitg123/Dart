There are three types of inheritance in dart:

	1. Single inheritance 
	2. Multi-Level inheritance
	3. Hierarchial inheritance

Inheritance in Dart can be achived through the key word "extends", Inheritance is when 
the charscters of parent class are there in child class i.e we can access all the values 
of the parent class from child class.

syntax:
	class car
	{
	   body of car class
	} 
	class price extends car
	{
	   body of price class
	}

we will understand better with an example.
