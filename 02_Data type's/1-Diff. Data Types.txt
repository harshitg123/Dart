In Dart there are 5 Basics Data types.
  1. int
  2. double
  3. String
  4. bool 

The above 4 are the fundamental or can be execute on compile time 
but there is 1 data type name called 'dynamic', which execute at run time.
  5. dynamic


Note 1: In order to define above data types we can also define them by writing 'var' it 
        automatically detect that which type of data type has to defined based on the type of 
        value is assigned to them.
        
          example:
<<<<<<< HEAD:2-Data type's/1-Diff. Data Types.txt
                  var num = 100 OR int num = 100 (These both are same)
=======
                  var num = 100  OR int num = 100
>>>>>>> 39809d1e9a13ee975a817692ad62cf26484f2e97:Data type's/1-Diff. Data Types.txt
                  
                  var name = 'harsh' OR String name = 'harsh' (These both are same)

Note 2: In example you will see how these all 5 data types can be defined and 
        used in our program's.
