In oop(object oriented programming) class is very important in Dart we can make these classes:

syntex:
	class <name of the class>
	{
	   body of the class
	}
	main()
	{
           //object of the class
	   <Name of the class or var> <object name> = <Name of the class>(); 
	   and, body of the class
	}

Note: We will understand everything related to class from EXAMPLES.
