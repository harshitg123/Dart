set is un-structured or un-ordered collection's in Dart:

	general syntax of sets in Dart is:
			
		var <name> = {<values>,<values>};


1. Set do not contain same value if we insert same value to set it will only display 
   it once as we know from the defination of the set.

2. If we want to make an empty set we should use the following syntax:

		var <name> = <string or int or double>{};
			  or
		Set <string> <name> = {};
