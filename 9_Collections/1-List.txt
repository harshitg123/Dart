1. Like in most of the other programming languages array's are there in dart we 
   have "List" which is slightly upgraded from array. 

	general syntyax of List are:
	
		   List <name of the list> = [<value>,<value>,<value>];				


2. List has the index no. starting from 0.

3. List are mutable i.e the value of list can be changed.

		   <name of the list>[<index>] = "new value";


4. we can store any type of value's in List like String, int, double.

		   List employee = ["harshit", "Gupta", 24, 100000.5];


5. we can make list as specific for example String.

		   List <String> employee = ["harshit", "gupta"];


6. we can make the values of the list as constant also.

		   List <String> employee = const ["harshit", "gupta"];
   now this will not change the const keyword makes it immutable.

7. The length of the list can be calculated by:

		    <List_name>.length

8. we can copy one list to another list by:

		    List nam_1 = ["hello"];
		    List nam_2 = [];

		    nam_2 = [...nam_1];// this will copy the value of first list into second list.
